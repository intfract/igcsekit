  <h1>Metals</h1>
  <h2>Properties</h2>
  <p>Metals are generally:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>solids with high melting and boiling points</li>
    <li>malleable</li>
    <li>good conductors of electricity and heat</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Alloys</h3>
  <p>Alloys are mixtures of a metal with other elements.</p>
  <p>Alloys are used instead of pure metals because they may be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>more resistant to corrosion</li>
    <li>stronger</li>
    <li>harder</li>
    <li>less dense</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Alloys contain atoms of <strong>different sizes</strong> which distorts the regular arrangement
    of atoms in metals. This makes it harder for layers to
    <strong>slide</strong> over each other, therefore making an alloy less malleable.
  </p>
  <h2>Reactivity Series</h2>
  <p>
    The reactivity series is a list of metallic elements ranked their reactivity. Elements that are
    more reactive can <strong>displace</strong> less reactive elements from their compounds, forming
    a new compound.
  </p>
  <p>The reactivity series (starting with the most reactive element) is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Group 1
      <ul>
        <li>Potassium</li>
        <li>Sodium</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Group 2
      <ul>
        <li>Calcium</li>
        <li>Magnesium</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Group 3
      <ul>
        <li>Aluminium</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Carbon</li>
    <li>
      Transition Metals
      <ul>
        <li>Zinc</li>
        <li>Iron</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Hydrogen</li>
    <li>
      Precious Metals
      <ul>
        <li>Copper</li>
        <li>Silver</li>
        <li>Gold</li>
        <li>Platinum</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Group 1 and 2 <strong>react violently</strong> with cold water to produce hydrogen gas.<br
    />Transition metals will not react with water under normal conditions but
    <strong>will react with steam</strong>.<br />Precious metals are
    <strong>less reactive than hydrogen</strong> and will not react with water or steam.
  </p>
  <p>
    Only elements less reactive than carbon can be extracted from their ores through reduction with
    carbon.
  </p>
  <Callout emoji="ðŸ¤”">
    Typically, less reactive metals are more expensive. These metals are often found as pure
    elements in their ores and not as compounds.
  </Callout>
  <p>The reactivity of a metal can be described as its tendency to form a positive ion.</p>
  <h2>Metal Extraction</h2>
  <p>The extraction of metals from their ores is dependent on the reactivity series.</p>
  <h3>Reduction with Carbon</h3>
  <p>Some metals are extracted using carbon. One such metal is iron.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hematite is loaded into a blast furnace</li>
    <li>Iron is extracted from hematite using carbon monoxide</li>
    <li>Calcium carbonate is used to remove acidic impurities from the ore</li>
    <li>Calcium carbonate thermally decomposes into calcium oxide which forms slag</li>
    <li>Slag is separately removed from the furnace</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Important reactions take place inside the blast furnace. Coke is used to make carbon monoxide.
  </p>
  <div class="equation">
    C + O<sub>2</sub> â†’ CO<sub>2</sub>
  </div>
  <div class="equation">
    C + CO<sub>2</sub> â†’ 2CO
  </div>
  <p>Hematite is reduced by carbon monoxide to extract pure iron.</p>
  <div class="equation">
    Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3CO â†’ 2Fe + 3CO<sub>2</sub>
  </div>
  <p>
    Calcium carbonate used to remove acidic impurities decomposes due to high temperatures (thermal
    decomposition).
  </p>
  <div class="equation">
    CaCO<sub>3</sub> â†’ CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>
  </div>
  <p>
    Calcium oxide reacts with silica impurities from sand to form slag containing calcium silicate.
  </p>
  <div class="equation">
    CaO + SiO<sub>2</sub> â†’ CaSiO<sub>3</sub>
  </div>
  <h3>Electrolysis</h3>
  <p>
    Metals more reactive than carbon are extracted using electrolysis. For example, aluminium is
    extracted from bauxite by electrolysis. Aluminium oxide (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) has a
    <strong>high melting point</strong>
    that needs to be lowered by mixing it with molten <strong>cryolite</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The extraction of aluminium by electrolysis, known as the Hall-HÃ©roult process, uses a large
    container whose base is made of graphite. This base acts as the cathode (negative electrode) in
    the electrolysis. The anode (positive electrode), also made of graphite, is inserted into the
    electrolyte from above.
  </p>
  <p>This ionic half-equation describes the reaction occurring at the cathode:</p>
  <div class="equation">
    Al<sup>3+</sup> + 3e<sup>-</sup> â†’ Al
  </div>
  <p>This ionic half-equation describes the reaction occurring at the anode:</p>
  <div class="equation">
    2O<sup>2-</sup> â†’ O<sub>2</sub> + 4e<sup>-</sup>
  </div>
  <p>
    The aluminium that forms at the cathode (the base of the container) pools at the bottom and can
    be tapped out as it is molten. The oxygen that forms at the anode, under the high temperature of
    the process, reacts with the carbon (graphite) anode to form carbon dioxide. The anode therefore
    gradually burns away and must be replaced.
  </p>
  <h3>Recycling</h3>
  <p>It is important to recycle metals because metal ores are a finite resource.</p>
  <h2>Uses of Metals</h2>
  <h3>Aluminium</h3>
  <p>Aluminium is used in:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>aircraft parts because of its strength and low density</li>
    <li>food containers because of its resistance to corrosion</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Aluminium has an apparent unreactivity and resistance to corrision because of a protective oxide
    layer that adheres to the surface of aluminium. This layer prevents further oxidation.
  </p>
  <h3>Steel</h3>
  <p>
    Steel is an alloy made from iron and carbon. Mild steel is used in car bodies and machinery
    while stainless steel (an alloy of steel with chromium and nickel) is used in cutlery. Steel is
    an alloy that is stronger and has a higher melting point than its constituents.
  </p>
  <h3>Zinc</h3>
  <p>Zinc is used for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>galvanising iron and steel to prevent corrosion (rusting)</li>
    <li>making brass by mixing it with copper</li>
  </ul>
  Another alloy of copper is bronze, which is made from copper and tin.
